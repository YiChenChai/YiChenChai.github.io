## Introduction
On around 13 Jul, I chanced upon this [article](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/07/13/microsoft-discovers-threat-actor-targeting-solarwinds-serv-u-software-with-0-day-exploit/) warning users of Solarwinds Serv-U against a pre-auth SSH RCE bug being exploited in the wild. This was pretty interesting to me, as I didn't think SSH RCE was still possible in a year like 2021. What followed was a 2 month long on and off exploration of the Serv-U SSH codebase. In the end, the original team at Microsoft released a (more authoritative) [writeup](https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/09/02/a-deep-dive-into-the-solarwinds-serv-u-ssh-vulnerability/) a few days before I figured out the bug. Nonetheless, the following two-part series would hopefully present a different perspective on the vulnerability analysis process. Part 1, or this post, will go through my process behind identifying and triggering the vulnerability, while part 2 will demonstrate how I made use of the vulnerability to gain RCE. Do note that all this research were done on the Windows version of Serv-U.

## What is Serv-U?

![](/images/7/serv-u.png)
*Serv-U*

Solarwinds [Serv-U](https://www.serv-u.com/) is a file-sharing server for both Windows and Linux. One of its features is to allow file transfers via SFTP, a file transfer protocol built on top of the SSH protocol. CVE-2021-35211 is a memory corruption vulnerability in the SFTP component of Serv-U which can take place even before a successful SSH login, and affects Serv-U 15.2.3 HotFix 1 on both OSes.

## SSH Primer
To exploit an SSH server, it is imperative to understand how the SSH protocol works. This post [here](https://goteleport.com/blog/ssh-handshake-explained/) does a wonderful technical explanation on how the server and client establish an encrypted communication channel using what is called an SSH handshake. The following graphic shows a simplified version of how the handshake works:

![](/images/7/diagram1.png)
*Figure 1. Simplified SSH Handshake*

Initially, all packets are sent unencrypted. After exchanging banners, the server and client exchange SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT packets and both parties would decide on what key exchange and symmetric encryption algorithms to use based on a fixed set of rules. The client then sends an SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_INIT packet and the server responds with an SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_REPLY packet to facilitate [key exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_exchange). Finally, with both parties sharing a common secret key, the client sends SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS, which causes both parties to start sending encrypted packets to each other.

## Initial analysis
The initial Microsoft article provided me with little to go with; I knew [Hotfix 2](https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Serv-U-15-2-3-HotFix-2?language=en_US) patched the bug, and what error Serv-U will log when the exploit fails, as listed below:

```
EXCEPTION: C0000005; CSUSSHSocket::ProcessReceive(); Type: 30; puchPayLoad = 0x03e909f6; nPacketLength = 76; nBytesReceived = 80; nBytesUncompressed = 156; uchPaddingLength = 5
```

With a little bit of work, I managed to get my hands on both Hotfix 1 and 2 packages. Inside, the main file of interest would be Serv-U.dll, which does the majority of the SSH handling. For my analysis, I would be using the dll from Hotfix 1.

I was quickly able to locate the (16-bit) error string mentioned in the article and associate it with the ProcessReceive function at 0x180144E90.

![](/images/7/exception.png)
*Figure 2. Error string in exception handler*

From a cursory analysis of the case switch statement inside ProcessReceive, I was able to deduce that the case switch code read SSH packets and dispatched them to their respective handling functions based on type message (SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT etc.).

![](/images/7/caseswitch.png)
*Figure 3. Case switch in ProcessReceive*

For this vulnerability, the most important functions would be packet_20_1801445D0, packet_30_180144420 and packet_21_180144870, which correspond to SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT, SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_INIT and SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS.

## Annotating the code
Without symbols, the code was pretty much unreadable, with unknown functions calling more unknown functions. My big break came when I realised that a bunch of functions seemed to share a similar pattern as follows:

```c
__int64 __fastcall sub_18015FF40(__int64 a1)
{
  __int64 result; // rax

  if ( (*(_BYTE *)(a1 + 8) & 1) != 0 )
  {
    result = *(_QWORD *)(a1 + 2232);
    if ( result )
      result = ((__int64 (__fastcall *)())result)();
  }
  return result;
}
```

Each function dereferenced a different offset of its first argument and  then uses it as a function pointer to call, and this pattern looked awfully like the usage of a virtual table. My theory was confirmed after I found sub_180160D34. Here is an small portion of the function:

```c
v1 = 0;
  if ( (*(_BYTE *)(a1 + 8) & 1) != 0 )
    return 1;
  v4 = LoadLibraryW(L"libeay32.DLL");
  *(_QWORD *)(a1 + 16) = v4;
  if ( !v4 )
    goto LABEL_331;
  BIO_new_fp = GetProcAddress(v4, "BIO_new_fp");
  *(_QWORD *)(a1 + 520) = BIO_new_fp;
  if ( !BIO_new_fp )
    return 0;
  BIO_free = GetProcAddress(*(HMODULE *)(a1 + 16), "BIO_free");
  *(_QWORD *)(a1 + 528) = BIO_free;
  if ( !BIO_free )
    return 0;
  BIO_new_socket = GetProcAddress(*(HMODULE *)(a1 + 16), "BIO_new_socket");
  *(_QWORD *)(a1 + 536) = BIO_new_socket;
  if ( !BIO_new_socket )
    return 0;
  BIO_s_mem = GetProcAddress(*(HMODULE *)(a1 + 16), "BIO_s_mem");
  *(_QWORD *)(a1 + 544) = BIO_s_mem;
  if ( !BIO_s_mem )
    return 0;
  BIO_s_file = GetProcAddress(*(HMODULE *)(a1 + 16), "BIO_s_file");
  *(_QWORD *)(a1 + 552) = BIO_s_file;
 ``` 

As can be seen, the function looks up OpenSSL functions from libeay32.dll and use them to populate the virtual table at a1. With this understanding, I defined the structure for a1 and wrote an IDAPython [script](https://gist.github.com/YiChenChai/72ea375c21b5514a87b3d22667c16482) to find all the wrapper functions with the same pattern as sub_18015FF40 and rename them based on their API call. Here is what the code looks like after:

```c
v1 = 0;
  if ( (a1->pad[8] & 1) != 0 )
    return 1;
  v4 = LoadLibraryW(L"libeay32.DLL");
  a1->libeay32 = v4;
  if ( !v4 )
    goto LABEL_331;
  BIO_new_fp = GetProcAddress(v4, "BIO_new_fp");
  a1->BIO_new_fp = BIO_new_fp;
  if ( !BIO_new_fp )
    return 0;
  BIO_free = GetProcAddress(a1->libeay32, "BIO_free");
  a1->BIO_free = BIO_free;
  if ( !BIO_free )
    return 0;
  BIO_new_socket = GetProcAddress(a1->libeay32, "BIO_new_socket");
  a1->BIO_new_socket = BIO_new_socket;
  if ( !BIO_new_socket )
    return 0;
  BIO_s_mem = GetProcAddress(a1->libeay32, "BIO_s_mem");
  a1->BIO_s_mem = BIO_s_mem;
  if ( !BIO_s_mem )
    return 0;
  BIO_s_file = GetProcAddress(a1->libeay32, "BIO_s_file");
  a1->BIO_s_file = BIO_s_file;
  ```
The same function after renaming:

```c
__int64 __fastcall DH_free_18015FF40(struct COpenSSL *a1)
{
  __int64 result; // rax

  if ( (a1->pad[8] & 1) != 0 )
  {
    result = (__int64)a1->DH_free;
    if ( result )
      result = ((__int64 (__fastcall *)())result)();
  }
  return result;
}
```

Now, with my own makeshift "symbols", understanding the code became a lot easier.

### Key Exchange Init (SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT)
When parsing a packet SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT, we eventually reach a function I called parse_1801403C0.

![](/images/7/parse.png)
*Figure 4. Link between packet_20_1801445D0 and parse_1801403C0*

It makes 6 functions calls sequentially, with 2 of them to prep_symm_enc_18013F840:

![](/images/7/insideparse.png)
*Figure 5. Inside parse_1801403C0*

If we look into prep_symm_enc_18013F840, we notice that it involved strings such as "aes128-cbc" and made use of OpenSSL functions such as EVP_aes_128_cbc and EVP_CipherInit_ex (see Figure 6). This pattern of OpenSSL API usage is used for symmetric encryption/decryption, and an example can be found [here](https://github.com/anbreen/encryption-using-openssl/blob/master/aes-implementation.c). It is therefore logical to assume that the calls to prep_symm_enc_18013F840 were to implement the symmetric encryption portion of the SSH handshake.

![](/images/7/symmenc.png)
*Figure 6. Inside prep_symm_enc_18013F840*

Since there was a pair of calls to the prep_symm_enc_18013F840, I deduced that the calls were responsible for creating OpenSSL EVP contexts for the client-to-server (a1 + 1112) and server-to-client (a1 + 1120) encrypted communication channels respectively (Note: client-to-server and server-to-client comms can use different encryption algorithms). 

Recall that a key exchange has not taken place yet when the server and client are exchanging SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT packets. As such, the server does not possess shared keys and IVs with the client and can only call EVP_EncryptInit_ex with most fields as null, which is valid as stated [here](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.0.2/man3/EVP_EncryptInit_ex.html):

![](/images/7/evp_cipher.png)
*Figure 7. Documentation for EVP_EncryptInit_ex*

### Actual Key Exchange (SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_INIT)
Moving on to the parsing of SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_INIT, or packet 30, the bulk of the code logic is in a function I (aptly) named kex_shiz_180142950. Towards the end of the function, we see 6 very similar pieces of code:

![](/images/7/6piece.png)
*Figure 8. 6 pieces of code (not all inside image)*

The purpose behind this code can be found in the RFC, specifically in [section 7.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4253#section-7.2). Essentially, after the key exchange has occurred, this code is used to generate shared keys and IVs with the client. Note that EVP_EncryptInit_ex is called a second time on a1 + 1120, but this time with the IV and key. With this, encryption / decryption can take place.

### Switch to encrypted communication (SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS)

So far, all packets had been sent in the plain. After receiving the last plaintext packet, SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS, the server calls calls packet_21_180144870 which assigns a1 + 1120 to a1 + 1104.

![](/images/7/assign.png)
*Figure 9. Now a1 + 1104 holds the AES context*

From now on, when sending encrypted packets to the client, the server will use this EVP_CIPHER_CTX object stored in a1 + 1104.

## Bindiffing
Now, on to the actual bindiffing. The patch was deceptively simple, which made me doubt my judgement quite a couple of times throughout the analysis. As can be seen below, in the patched version, the patch adds a check at the start of packet_30_180144420 to ensure the value of a1 + 408 is 3 before continuing:

![](/images/7/bindiff.png)
*Figure 10. Change to packet_30_180144420*

When the updated kex_shiz_180142950 completes successfully, it then assigns 4 to a1 + 408...

![](/images/7/bindiff1.png)
*Figure 11. Change to kex_shiz_180142950*

...which will be checked for in the updated packet_21_180144870:

![](/images/7/bindiff2.png)
*Figure 12. Change to packet_21_180144870*

With the patch, the order of packets received is now restricted to the correct order specified by the RFC. For example, if the server receives SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_INIT instead of SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT as the first packet after banner exchange, the function parsing the packet will immediately bail as a1 + 408 is not set to the correct value of 3.

From here, I had 3 hypotheses of how the bug may be triggered:

1. Send SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_INIT as the first packet
2. Send an invalid SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT packet that causes parsing to fail and leave some fields uninitialised, then send an SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_INIT
3. Rearrange SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT, SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_INIT and SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS in an invalid order

In retrospect, the log entry provided by Microsoft became a red herring in my analysis, as it made me incorrectly assume that the root cause of the bug was somehow in kex_shiz_180142950 which parses SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_INIT. After the first idea was quickly proven wrong, I moved on to the second idea and tried to send all kinds of invalid SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT packets in hopes of triggering a crash, which did not work.

It was only a month of aimlessly testing that I thought of the third possibility. By that time, the Microsoft blog post was released for 1-2 days but I had no idea. After a little testing, I was amazed to find out that just by sending a single SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS packet, I managed to crash the server. It was that simple all along. However, looking at the logs and crash location, I quickly realised the crash was not what was reported by Microsoft.

![](/images/7/firstcrash.png)
*Figure 13. The first crash*

The crash happened instead in the packet parsing function at get_pkt_1801411E0, which I did not expect. After some brief analysis, I found the reason: after SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS is received, the server will treat that all subsequent packets received from the client as encrypted and would try to use the EVP context at a1 + 1096 to decrypt any subsequent packets received; however, without a prior SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT, the field a1 + 1096 holding the decryption context would be left as NULL, causing a null-pointer dereference.

![](/images/7/firstcrash1.png)
*Figure 14. Cause of crash*

To remedy this issue was simple: I just had to tell the server that client-to-server packets could only be sent in the plain. To do this, I sent an SSH2_MSG_KEXINIT packet before SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS specifying that client-to-server encryption could only be "none", which was supported (though not encouraged) according to the [RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4253#section-6.3). After this, I sent an SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_INIT packet and boom, the server crashed, with the same log entry as Microsoft documented. 

![](/images/7/realcrash.png)
*Figure 15. Crash reproduced!*

The following is my analysis of the root cause of the vulnerability: as the server did not receive an SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_INIT packet, no key exchange took place and the previously mentioned second call to EVP_EncryptInit_ex would hence not occur.

However, as the server does not check if an SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_INIT packet had been received before using new keys, it accepts the subsequent SSH2_MSG_NEWKEYS packet as valid and treats the encryption context at a1 + 1120 as valid.

![](/images/7/diagram2.png)
*Figure 16. Process of triggering the vulnerability*

When I then send an SSH2_MSG_KEXDH_INIT packet, or in fact any packet that elicits a server-side response, the server will attempt to encrypt its response packet, and it does this with EVP_EncryptUpdate. When the EVP_CIPHER_CTX context is initialised with AES 128 CTR, the EVP_EncryptUpdate call eventually leads to a call to [aes_ctr_cipher](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/e59bfbaa2dbd680f77e1121e382502bd522a466c/crypto/evp/e_aes.c#L2528):

```c
static int aes_ctr_cipher(EVP_CIPHER_CTX *ctx, unsigned char *out,
                          const unsigned char *in, size_t len)
{
    int n = EVP_CIPHER_CTX_get_num(ctx);
    unsigned int num;
    EVP_AES_KEY *dat = EVP_C_DATA(EVP_AES_KEY,ctx);

    if (n < 0)
        return 0;
    num = (unsigned int)n;

    if (dat->stream.ctr)
        CRYPTO_ctr128_encrypt_ctr32(in, out, len, &dat->ks,
                                    ctx->iv,
                                    EVP_CIPHER_CTX_buf_noconst(ctx),
                                    &num, dat->stream.ctr);
    else
        CRYPTO_ctr128_encrypt(in, out, len, &dat->ks,
                              ctx->iv,
                              EVP_CIPHER_CTX_buf_noconst(ctx), &num,
                              dat->block);
    EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_num(ctx, num);
    return 1;
}
```

In the else case, dat->block, or ctx->cipher_data->block, is used as a function pointer. ctx->cipher_block comes from a OPENSSL_zalloc [here](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/e59bfbaa2dbd680f77e1121e382502bd522a466c/crypto/evp/evp_enc.c#L294). The astute reader might be wondering how OPENSSL_zalloc can cause uninitialised memory use when it zeroes out its allocated heap buffer.

As it turns out, doing a git blame on line 294 shows us that the commit which introduced the use of OPENSSL_zalloc was in a [2006](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/commit/b51bce942023325e727ca4225252d06c49d8f2b7). Unfortunately, Serv-U appears to use a version of libeay32.dll that was dated back to 2005. If only they had just used a more up-to-date libeay32, this vulnerability would probably be unexploitable.

![](/images/7/libeay32.png)
*Figure 17. libeay32.dll used by Serv-U*

Moving on to cipher_data->block, we see that it is assigned in [aes_init_key](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/e59bfbaa2dbd680f77e1121e382502bd522a466c/crypto/evp/e_aes.c#L163), which is called from [here](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/e59bfbaa2dbd680f77e1121e382502bd522a466c/crypto/evp/evp_enc.c#L370). As seen from the line 369, if we do not call EVP_CipherInit_ex with a non-NULL key, this chain of calls will never happen, leaving cipher_data->block uninitialised. This causes the use of an uninitialised function pointer.

## Conclusion

Where do we go from here? Stay tuned for part 2 on a detailed writeup on how I exploited this vulnerability to gain RCE.
