## Where I've been
Hiya, I've been off this blog for a long, long time. I haven't forgotten about it at all in these years, by the way. Undergrad's been a little busy, followed by work. Most importantly, I haven't found anything too interesting to write about. Yeah, I've done CTFs here and there, but honestly, artificial pwn challenges are really not my cup of tea anymore.

Ironically, my next blog post, hopefully coming out next week, will be on a challenge I playtested in a CTF. In my defence, it is basically just exploiting a V8 n-day, but with a twist (I am not good enough for 0-days :P). Also, there will be future blog posts on reverse engineering planned. I will also link to resources on how my colleague and I at [Bugscale](https://bugscale.ch) got a Samsung Galaxy 0-day, after our talk at [Insomni'Hack](https://insomnihack.ch/talks/shoot-for-the-galaxies-our-samsung-s25-1-click-rce-journey/).
