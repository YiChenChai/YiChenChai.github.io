I am a cybersecurity hobbyist based in Cambridge, UK (formerly Singapore). I graduated with a CS undergrad from the University of Cambridge, and am now working remotely for [Bugscale](https://bugscale.ch).

I mainly focus on pwn, or exploit development, and reverse engineering; I very rarely dabble with cryptography. I've also have some experience with Android exploitation and reverse engineering.

Besides my Twitter and Github links in the footer, I can be contacted via email at: eWljaGVuLmNoYWkgKGF0KSBnbWFpbCAoZG90KSBjb20=
用中文交流完全可以。
