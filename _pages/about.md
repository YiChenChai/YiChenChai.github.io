I am a cybersecurity hobbyist based in Cambridge University, UK (formerly Singapore).

I mainly focus on pwn, or exploit development, and reverse engineering; I occasionally dabble with cryptography as well.

Besides my Twitter and Github links in the footer, I can be contacted via email at: eWljaGVuLmNoYWkgKGF0KSBnbWFpbCAoZG90KSBjb20=
用中文交流完全可以。
